# column-comparator
Easy python script to compare columns in dataset

After running the event we've been organizing we decided that we should send surveys to runners and get feedback to improve our event next year.
We've had one csv file with all members signed up for this event which includes their email addressees and second csv with a list of those who in fact took part in the run, but without csv.
The issue was that we wanted to send surveys just to those who in fact took part and number of users was too big to filter it manually
